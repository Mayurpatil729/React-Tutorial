### Hooks

1. Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
2. Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.
3. Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.
   There are 3 rules for hooks:

- Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
- Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
- Hooks cannot be conditional.
