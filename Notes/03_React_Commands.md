#### React Basic Code

1. ReactDOM.render
   This method is used to render a React component into the DOM. It takes two arguments: the first is the component to render, and the second is the DOM element where the component should be .

2. <React.StrictMode>
   <App />
   </React.StrictMode>
   <React.StrictMode> is a wrapper component provided by React that helps with highlighting potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. This is particularly useful for identifying deprecated methods and other issues during development.

import React from 'react'; // Importing the React library to use JSX and React components
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; // Importing ReactDOM to render the React component to the DOM
import App from './App'; // Importing the root App component
import './assets/styles/global.css'; // Importing global CSS styles

// Rendering the App component to the DOM
ReactDOM.render(
// Wrapping the App component in React.StrictMode for additional checks and warnings
<React.StrictMode>
<App /> {/_ The root component of the application _/}
</React.StrictMode>,
document.getElementById('root') // Specifying the DOM element where the app will be mounted
);
