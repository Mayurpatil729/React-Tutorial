History of React.js

React.js began as an internal tool for dynamic
Facebook components.
Created in 2011 but remained private initially.
React.js was open-sourced by Jordan Walke and
Tom Occhino at JSConfUS 2013.
Released with the belief that its success at
Facebook could benefit others.
Initially faced criticism for combining JavaScript
and HTML in a single file.
It was widely hated and criticized because of its
combination of JavaScript and HTML in single file.
It slowly gained traction and blew up in adoption.

• React is not a framework. React is a JavaScript library for
building user interfaces.
• It is also known as ReactJS and React.js, so don't get
confused if you read different notation in different places.
• React knows only one thing that is to create an awesome UI.

• React is declarative because it describes what the UI should look like rather than how to achieve it. This makes the code easier to read and maintain, as it is more focused on the end result rather than the steps involved in getting there.

Why React.js?
• React is the Most Popular JavaScript library for building user
interfaces.
• Component-Based Architecture
• Declarative Ul
• Rich Ecosystem - npm packages
• Strong Community Support - Online / Github
